                    <h2 class="h3 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>MoodSync was created with a simple but powerful mission: to help people understand and manage their emotions better. By combining cutting-edge AI technology with psychological insights, we've built a tool that can detect emotions in real-time and provide personalized suggestions to improve your mental wellbeing.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-4 mt-5">How It Works</h2>
                    <p>MoodSync uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze facial expressions and detect emotions. Our system can recognize seven basic emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral. Based on the detected emotion, MoodSync provides personalized suggestions, activities, and resources to help you manage your emotions effectively.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-4 mt-5">Our Technology</h2>
                    <p>The emotion detection system is powered by a deep learning model trained on thousands of facial expression images. We use TensorFlow for the backend processing and Flask for the web application. All your data is stored securely and is only used to improve your experience with MoodSync.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="h3 mb-4 mt-5">Privacy & Security</h2>
